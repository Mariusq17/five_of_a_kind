              The muscles of the shoulder support and produce the movements of
              the shoulder girdle. They attach the appendicular skeleton of the
              upper limb to the axial skeleton of the trunk. Four of them are
              found on the anterior aspect of the shoulder, whereas the rest are
              located on the shoulder’s posterior aspect and in the back.

              <p class="descp movement-descp">
                The military press is a complete shoulder building exercise
                perfect for building shoulder muscle. The military press is an
                exercise with many names and is often referred to as the
                shoulder press, overhead press, and strict press. The military
                press is used primarily to build the deltoid muscle. It also
                indirectly targets the other muscles of the shoulder, your
                triceps, and your core. Since the military press is completed
                standing up, it involves a lot of core strength to help
                stabilize the spine while pressing weight overhead.

              <p class="descp movement-descp">
                The lateral raise is one of the best shoulder exercises for
                those looking to build shoulders like boulders. It’s also a very
                simple movement: essentially you just raise weights to the sides
                and up to shoulder level, then lower them again – though
                naturally we have some far more detailed advice about perfect
                form to follow. However, don’t let that simplicity fool you into
                thinking you’re in for an easy time. The lateral raise is
                devilishly hard, even with very light weights. What seems
                incredibly simple on rep one is absolute murder by rep eight, so
                pick your weight wisely.
