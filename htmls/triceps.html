            <p class="descp">
              The triceps brachii is a large, thick muscle on the dorsal part of
              the upper arm. It often appears in the shape of a horseshoe on the
              posterior aspect of the arm. The primary function of the triceps
              is the extension of the elbow joint. The triceps is structured
              into 3 parts: the long head, medial head and lateral head. The
              long head assists with the extension and adduction of the arm at
              the shoulder joint, the medial head is active during the forearm
              extension at the elbow joint when the forearm is supinated or
              pronated and the lateral head is considered to be the strongest
              out of the three.

                As you prepare for this move, face the tricep pushdown cable
                machine and grasp the horizontal cable bar or rope attachment
                (depending on the machine your gym has) with an overhand grip.
                Adjust the bar or rope grips to about chest level. Use the
                pin-and-place adjustment and set a low weight to start.
                Different versions of the machine may include other weighting
                mechanisms. Start by bracing your abdominals. Tuck your elbows
                in at your sides and position your feet slightly apart. Inhale.
                Push down until your elbows are fully extended but not yet in
                the straight, locked position. Try to keep your back as straight
                as possible as you push down. As you exhale, return to the
                starting point using a controlled movement. Try not to crash the
                weights.

                Lie face up on a flat gym bench. Your entire body should be on
                the bench, except your lower legs. Your knees are bent, and your
                feet are flat on the floor. Arms extend above the chest, elbows
                shoulder-width apart (not locked), and both hands hold one end
                of a dumbbell. Flex your elbows and lower the weight toward the
                top of your head. Your upper arms should remain relatively
                perpendicular to your body. This keeps the tension on the
                triceps versus shifting it to the shoulders. Continue lowering
                the weight behind the head. The bottom of the dumbbell head
                should be about in line with the bench's top, or even a little
                higher if this feels unwieldy. Keep from locking the elbow to
                maintain tension in your triceps muscle. Repeat.
