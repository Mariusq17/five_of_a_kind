              The pectoral region is located on the anterior chest wall. It
              contains four muscles that are used mainly in pushing motions and
              are hardly used in day to day activities.

              <p class="descp movement-descp">
                The bench press, or chest press, is a weight training exercise
                in which the trainee presses a weight upwards while lying on a
                weight training bench. Although the bench press is a full-body
                exercise, the muscles primarily used are the pectoralis major,
                the anterior deltoids, and the triceps, among other stabilizing
                muscles. A barbell is generally used to hold the weight, but a
                pair of dumbbells can also be used

              <h2 class="movement-title">Cable Fly</h2>
              <p class="descp movement-descp">
                The standing cable fly is a variation of the chest fly and an
                exercise used to strengthen the pushing muscles of the body
                including the chest, triceps, and shoulders. The standing cable
                fly can be tough to overload as it requires a great deal of core
                stability, so it is probably best used as an accessory movement
                for those looking to increase their chest muscle mass. This
                movement can be included into your chest workouts, push
                workouts, upper body workouts, or full body workouts.
